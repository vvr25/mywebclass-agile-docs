As a student, I want to organize my study materials in a digital format so that I can easily access them from anywhere. By scanning and uploading my notes and textbooks to a cloud storage platform, we can create a centralized location for all of my study materials. This will enable me to study efficiently and effectively, without worrying about losing or misplacing physical materials. By following agile principles, we can quickly and effectively create a user-friendly digital platform for organizing and accessing study materials. This will set me up for long-term success by allowing me to easily review and study materials throughout my academic career.
